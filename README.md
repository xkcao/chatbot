A bot that you can chat with.

## Who?
Anyone whose primary work is in front of a laptop.

## Why?
It can be boring to log into your computer and dig into work every morning. 
This application is intended to be run right after you log in and provide users some morale support via simple interactions.

## What?
- it will be a browser based application
- it can access computer's camera and sound device.

## Step 1
Build a simple web page, which can access to computer's camera and sound device.

## Step 2
Apply a machine learning module, which will take the images from camera and produce a binary output. 
The output will be either "you look great" or "you do not look great".

## Step 3
Using pre-recorded sounds, the program will do one of the following.
1. If the program detects that you look great, then it will say "You look fantastic. Enjoy your day".
2. If the program detects that you do not look great, then it will say "Hey man, did you get enough sleep? Take it easy today."
